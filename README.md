# hospital_infection
This purpose of the project was to predict the probability of infection rate occured in hospitals around in United States. The motivation behind this prediction was 
to determine whether infection surveillance and control programs have reduced the rates of infection. Thus, such a model was proposed. A linear regression model was chosen 
and the code does best to choose the predictors using backward selection and Akeika Information Criterion. Moreover, it checks for potential problems of using such a model.
Furthermore, a score of how the model performed in respect of the test data is also given.
